PUBG Performance Tweak Guide
[Work-In-Progress]

OS Basics Checklist:
- Stop being a moron, don't skip these
- Reboot Windows EVERY day - Confirm that Task Manager shows zeroed uptime after restart
- If you're using Windows 10, it's time to move on and upgrade to Windows 11

1) Check for Windows updates
2) Check for GPU driver updates & do a clean reinstall
- NOTE: Clean reinstall WILL remove existing game-specific driver settings
3) Check for other device drivers (MOBO, UEFI, etc.)
4) Check OS and PUBG is on SSD with at least 20% free space (absolute minimum 10%)
- If you need to make space, trim the SSD afterwards (Optimise Drives)
5) Run SFC & DISM (system health check tools):
- Open CMD as Admin and run the following commands TWICE. If errors still left, plan for Windows reinstallation.
- - sfc /scannow
- - dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
+ This checks the health of Windows system files and tries to repair any issues
6) Enable Game Mode
- Search Game Mode
+ This optimizes Windows resource usage during gaming
7) Disable Xbox Game Bar
- Search Game Mode > Xbox Game Bar
+ Disables an unnecessary background service for PUBG
8) Experiment with Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling setting [ This is experimental and can be skipped ]
- Search Graphics Settings
+ May fix some stuttering issues in PUBG
9) Disable variable refresh rate [ This is experimental and can be skipped ]
- Search Graphics Settings
+ Potentially unnecessary compatibility feature for some games
10) If you use monitor scaling, override DPI scaling for TslGame.exe
- TslGame.Exe > Right Click: Properties > Compatibility > Change high DPI settings > High DPI scaling override: [x] Override...: Application
+ May fix some performance issues in PUBG
11) Disable unnecessary apps at startup
- Task Manager > Startup > Check apps with status enabled
+ May give better overall performance and faster reboots
12) Set page file size
- System Properties > Advanced > Performance: Settings... > Virtual Memory: Change...
- [ ] Automatically manage paging file size for all drives
- Set no paging files for all drives except C: (click Set everytime you change a setting)
- If you have 20GB+ RAM and don't run any special high memory usage applications, set C: custom size 4096MB (initial size & maximum size).
- If you have less than 20GB RAM or run special high memory usage applications, set (x) System managed size.
+ May help with unnecessary virtual memory usage, which is slower than normal memory

PUBG, Wellbia Anticheat Uninstallation [ This is experimental and can be skipped ]:
1) Delete C:\Windows\xhunter1.sys
2) Delete C:\Program Files\Common Files\Uncheater
3) Find and delete registry entries with keywords "xhunter" and "ucldr"
4) Block Wellbia from reinstalling itself:
- NOTE: This doesn't work on Windows Home editions. If you have one, go upgrade please. You can find a key from any key shop. Otherwise Enable UAC and at the start of the game always disallow Wellbia prompt.
- Local Group Policy Editor > Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Software Restriction Policies > Additional Rules > Right Click: New Path Rule
- - Path: %LocalAppData%\WELLBIA\*.exe
- - Security level : Disallowed
- - OK
- - Path: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\PUBG\TslGame\Binaries\Win64\TslGame_UC.exe
- - Security level : Disallowed
- - OK
+ May fix some game crashes, BSODs and stuttering issues.

PUBG, Reset Game Settings:
- Do this after every game update & game crash
1) Confirm you've saved game settings to cloud
2) Exit PUBG
3) Delete %LocalAppData%\TslGame\Saved
4) Restore settings from cloud
+ May prevent some game crashes

PUBG, Render Scale Check:
1) Exit PUBG
2) Open %LocalAppData%\TslGame\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor\GameUserSettings.ini
- Confirm ScreenScale decimals are zeros only
- Also check sg.ResolutionQuality, InGameCustomFrameRateLimit, MasterSoundVolume, EffectSoundVolume, EmoteSoundVolume, BGMSoundVolume, PlaygroundBGMSoundVolume, PlaygroundWebSoundVolume, FpsCameraFov, Gamma, GammasForMap,ForceFeedbackMultiplier, FrameRateLimit 
+ May prevent some performance issues

PUBG, Remove Video Files:
1) Delete C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\PUBG\TslGame\Content\Movies
+ Faster startup of PUBG

PUBG, Experiment with Full-Screen Optimisations [ This is experimental and can be skipped ]:
1) C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\PUBG\TslGame\Binaries\Win64 > Right Click: Properties > Compatibility > Enable or Disable full-screen optimisations
+ May fix some stuttering issues

PUBG, Reinstall Game:
- TODO: Add steps for uninstalling Anticheats etc.
- Could also try verifying files
+ Good "catch-all" fix

PUBG, Disable In-Game Overlays:
- Discord, Steam, Rivatuner, etc.
+ May prevent some performance issues, for ex. anticheats repeatedly scanning overlays.

PUBG, Disable Replays & Deathcams:
+ May prevent some performance issues

PUBG, Set Up GSYNC:
1) NVIDIA Control Panel > Set Up G-SYNC
- [x] Enable G-SYNC, G-SYNC Compatible
- (x) Enable for full screen mode
2) NVIDIA Control Panel > Manage 3D settings > Program Settings > Select a program to customise: tslgame.exe
- Low Latency Mode: Ultra [Optionally set: On]
- Max Frame Rate: Off
- Monitor Technology: G-SYNC
- Power management mode: Prefer maximum performance
- Preferred refresh rate: Highest available
- Vertical Sync: On
3) PUBG Graphics Settings:
- In-Game Framelimit: 
- - 144hz -> 130FPS
- - 165hz -> 150FPS
- - 240hz -> 220FPS
- - Optionally lower framelimit to ~90% avg FPS [ You may use CapframeX to determine your actual average FPS in-game ]
- Lobby Framelimit: 60 FPS
- Vertical Sync: Off
4) Windows Advanced Display Settings:
- Refresh Rate: Select Highest
+ Provides smoother performance

PUBG, Use DirectX 11e:
+ Should provide overall smoother game experience

PUBG, Render Scale tuning: [Experimental, wrongly configured may cause severe performance issues]
- NOTE: Requires high end PC (likely 3080ti or better) 
1) Open %LocalAppData%\TslGame\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor\GameUserSettings.ini
- Set ScreenScale a value between 120 and 200 (eg. 125 or 150)
- Set sg.AntiAliasingQuality to 0
- Set bSharpen to True
2) NVIDIA Control Panel > Manage 3D Settings > Program Settings > Select a program to customise: tslgame.exe > Antialiasing - Mode: Off
+ Mostly a personal preference, but may provide better and "more accurate" image quality due to not using AA.

PUBG, Optional startup parameteres:
- koreanrating -> blood is green
- nosplash -> no PUBG logo prompt at the start up


SOME TOOLS FOR PERSONAL EXPERIMENTATION:
--

ISLC For Low-End PCs [Experimental, unclear suitability]:
- Clears standby ("cache") memory on a timed interval
- May ease stuttering for lower end PCs
- Read more at https://www.wagnardsoft.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1256

Process Lasso:
- Useful all-around tool for managing computer resources
- Requires a license - relatively inexpensive
- Shouldn't be needed for Windows 11 with Intel CPUs
- Read more at https://bitsum.com/get-lasso-pro/

Cloudflare WARP+:
- May help with network/ping/latency issues
- It's a VPN product and may be useful with cheap home network devices
- Subscription 5$/mo, subscribe via phone app & copy license key
- Read more at https://1.1.1.1

Windows, Disable Virtual-Based Security & Memory Integrity:
- At your own risk - Weakens the security of your computer
- Disabling should give a small performance boost for your CPU
- Note that VBS is required for virtualization features

Visual C++ Redistributable:
https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170

https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0

Inventory screen character render disable?
+ Potentially better performance

Universal Scope Sensitivity:
- Zoom-specific sensitivies are absolutely unintuitive and needs to be configured via config file as in-game rounds off decimals terribly wrong
- 4x sensitivity is actually for 4.2x (ACOG)
- Zoom adjustable scopes have unintuitive sensitivities between zoom levels

Scoping Sensitivity:
- 15x major pixel skips with <22 sens
- 8x major pixel skips with <13 sens

bUseActionQueuing=True
bPreloadingMap=False
